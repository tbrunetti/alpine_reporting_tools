This Report was created to demonstrate the resource use by CU Anschutz (AMC) users on the Alpine HPC system. Highlighted in this report is the monthly active AMC users, as well as the queue times for each partition by AMC users, reported as a graph and as a table of statistics.

A partition referes to a type of node installed on Alpine. Partitions included in this report are aa100, a high level GPU partition; amilan, the most commonly used CPU partition (2 types of amilan); and amem, a high memory partition.
